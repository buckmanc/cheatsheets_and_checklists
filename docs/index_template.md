# Cheatsheets and Checklists

A simple repo of personal reference material written in Markdown. Peruse at your leisure, preferably with a cup of bean water in a cozy tavern run by an orc who never told anyone in book one what happened in the prequel.

Check out the [repo](https://github.com/buckmanc/cheatsheets_and_checklists), the [site](https://cheatsheets-and-checklists.pages.dev), or maybe even [local dev](http://herschel.local:232/), if you're in the right place.
