# The Silmarillion Reading Guide

## Abbreviated Reading

If you want to read The Silmarillion but find it too difficult, I recommend reading some of these chapters in isolation as individual stories.

1. Of Beren and Lúthien
2. The Children of Húrin (aka Narn i Chîn Húrin)
3. The Fall of Gondolin
4. TODO: which one of the creation tales?

The Children of Húrin is also available as a more fleshed out, [standalone book](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Hurin-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0618894640). The audiobook is [read by Christopher Lee](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Children-of-Hurin-Audiobook/B0036GTJP2). This version has more details but leaves out a few segments that tie it in with the rest of the Silmarillion.

## Difficult Chapters

Of Beleriand and its Realms is a notoriously difficult and boring chapter. It's got some lovely moments, but it's largely just land descriptions. If you get bored there, just skim it or skip it.

## Terms

There's a million terms for varying groups of elves; "the elves who went here" vs. "the elves who didn't", "the elves who went here but didn't go further" vs. "the elves who went further", etc etc etc. I made it thru my first read thru by defining each of these terms as simply "a group of elves".

## Audiobook

I've listened to the version [read by Martin Shaw](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Silmarillion-Audiobook/B016N9U1XW) several times and loved it; his tone and voice are appropriately epic for the material. But I'm sure the [Andy Serkis version](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Silmarillion-Audiobook/B0C5MPMQYX) is also very good.
