# Foreigner Notes

## Premise

A ship full of humans have to live with aliens that have different emotions than they do; namely they have no "love", but rather a hierarchical, team/herd/loyalty emotion called man'chi.

## Qualities

If you like...

- TNG, but you wish the episodes were hella slow
- Sanderson's time spent in character thoughts, but you wish it was only one character
- Austin's social drama, but you wish there were more politics, more aliens, more tea, and sometimes guns

...you will love this series.
