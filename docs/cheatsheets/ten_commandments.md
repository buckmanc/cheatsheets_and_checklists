Exodus 34:1-28
"Moses was there with the Lord... and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant — the Ten Commandments."

[^1]: The Ten Commandments are commonly sourced from [Exodus 20:1-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+20%3A1-17&version=NIV). However, the phrase "the Ten Commandments" does not appear there. The phrase is mentioned three times in the Bible and only once with a list of the commandments, in [Exodus 34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+34%3A1-28&version=NIV), which is a slightly more bizarre and esoteric list.
